# Previous Work
This directory contains outtakes of previous work i've written. Each folder has a corresponding description in this readme if context is needed.

## Bachelor
The template.yaml file describes the entire stack of the aws system used in the bachelors. 
 
The Userservice directory contains an outtake of the UserService used in the application. This microservice is written with the Hexagonal Architecture Pattern in mind, in order to isolate all business logic and external dependencies from the business logic. 
Each Apigateway endpoint has a corresponding function in UserInfrastructure, and each other AWS resource located in the UserExternal project.

## TechBlog
Contains an article i wrote for the IT-Minds techblog: [link](https://dev.to/itminds/enhancing-safety-by-embracing-types-548p). Recommend reading on the blog, but i've included the markdown file used in this directory.
The article is an explanation of how types in TypeScript can be used, in order to decrease runtime errors, and generally exploring the possibilities using types.
